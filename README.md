## Overview

The "AppSumo Title Collector Extension" is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users efficiently gather product titles from the AppSumo website. Users can click on product titles to save them locally within the extension. The collected titles can then be exported as a CSV file. This tool aims to streamline the research process for individuals interested in AppSumo Lifetime Deals (LTDs) by automating the manual task of data collection.

## Features

*   **One-Click Save:** Allows users to click on product titles on AppSumo.com to save them.
*   **Local Storage:** Stores collected product titles locally using `chrome.storage.local`.
*   **CSV Export:** Provides an option to export the collected list of titles as a CSV file (e.g., `appsumo_titles.csv`) with a header row (e.g., 'Product Title').
*   **Automatic Title Identification:** Identifies product titles on AppSumo product listing, search, and individual product pages. (Note: Relies on specific DOM selectors).
*   **User Feedback:** Provides visual feedback on the AppSumo page when a title is successfully saved.
*   **Popup Interface:** Browser action (toolbar icon) opens a popup for extension interaction.
*   **Popup Controls:**
    *   "Export to CSV" button.
    *   "Clear All Titles" button.
    *   Display of the total number of saved titles.
    *   Option to display the list of saved titles within the popup.
*   **Initialization:** Initializes local storage structure on extension installation.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for API calls and unexpected scenarios.

## Architecture

The extension is built using Chrome Extension APIs, adhering to Manifest V3 principles. The main components are:

1.  **Content Script (`appsumocontentscript.js`, `appsumocontentstyle.css`):**
    *   Injected into AppSumo web pages.
    *   `appsumocontentscript.js`: Identifies product titles, makes them interactive, captures titles upon user interaction, and sends them to the background service worker.
    *   `appsumocontentstyle.css`: Styles visual elements or feedback injected by the content script.

2.  **Background Service Worker (`background.js`, `backgroundstorageoperations.js`):**
    *   `background.js`: Runs independently, listening for messages (save title, export CSV, get count, clear all). Manages CSV generation and download.
    *   `backgroundstorageoperations.js`: Handles all interactions with `chrome.storage.local` for storing and retrieving titles.

3.  **Popup (`extensionpopuphtml.html`, `extensionpopupcontroller.js`, `extensionpopupcss.css`, `enhancedpopupfunctionality.js`):**
    *   Accessed via the extension's toolbar icon.
    *   `extensionpopuphtml.html`: Defines the popup's HTML structure.
    *   `extensionpopupcss.css`: Styles the popup's UI.
    *   `extensionpopupcontroller.js`: Main script for popup logic and user interactions.
    *   `enhancedpopupfunctionality.js`: Provides additional JavaScript for more complex popup features.
    *   The popup UI allows users to export titles, clear stored data, and view the count of collected titles.

4.  **Constants Module (`extensionconstants.js`):**
    *   Stores shared constants like storage keys, message action types, and potentially DOM selectors for identifying titles.

5.  **Localization & Messaging:**
    *   `_locales/en/messages.json`: Standard Chrome Extension localization file for English UI strings (used via `chrome.i18n` API).
    *   `localizationsupport.json`: Potentially for custom localization mechanisms or specific string management beyond standard i18n.
    *   `messages.json` (root level): Could be used for storing message formats, templates, or non-UI specific static text data, distinct from UI localization or constants.

Communication between components (e.g., content script to background, popup to background) is handled using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`.

## Installation

To install the AppSumo Title Collector Extension locally:

1.  **Download/Clone:** Download or clone the project files to your local machine.
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Ensure that "Developer mode" in the top right corner is enabled.
4.  **Load Unpacked:** Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5.  **Select Directory:** Navigate to the directory where you downloaded/cloned the project files and select it.

The extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

## Usage

### Saving Product Titles

1.  **Navigate to AppSumo:** Open your Chrome browser and go to an AppSumo page where products are listed (e.g., `appsumo.com/browse/`, `appsumo.com/products/*`, or search results).
2.  **Identify Titles:** The content script (`appsumocontentscript.js`) will automatically identify product titles and make them interactive (e.g., by adding a save icon or making the title itself clickable for saving).
3.  **Save a Title:** Click on the product title or its associated save icon.
4.  **Feedback:** The content script will provide visual feedback on the page indicating that the title has been saved.
5.  **Storage:** The title is sent to the background script and saved in `chrome.storage.local`. Duplicate titles are allowed by default.

### Managing and Exporting Titles

1.  **Open Popup:** Click the AppSumo Title Collector Extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2.  **View Count:** The popup will display the current number of titles saved.
3.  **Export to CSV:**
    *   Click the "Export to CSV" button.
    *   The background script will retrieve all saved titles, format them into a CSV file (e.g., `appsumo_titles.csv`), and initiate a download.
4.  **Clear All Titles:**
    *   Click the "Clear All Titles" button.
    *   You may be asked for confirmation.
    *   The background script will clear all titles from local storage.
    *   The title count in the popup will update to 0.
5.  **View Saved Titles (Optional):**
    *   The popup may include functionality (potentially via `enhancedpopupfunctionality.js`) to display the list of currently saved titles directly within the popup interface.

## File Structure and Components

The project consists of the following key files:

*   **`manifest.json`**:
    *   Defines the extension's metadata, permissions (storage, scripting, downloads, host permissions for `appsumo.com`), version, and entry points for scripts and UI components.
    *   Specifies `default_locale: "en"` for internationalization.
*   **`appsumocontentscript.js`**:
    *   JavaScript file injected into AppSumo pages.
    *   Responsible for identifying product titles using DOM selectors, making them interactive, capturing title text upon user interaction, sending titles to the background script, and providing visual feedback.
*   **`appsumocontentstyle.css`**:
    *   CSS file providing styles for any visual elements or feedback (e.g., save icons, notifications) injected by `appsumocontentscript.js` onto AppSumo pages.
*   **`background.js`**:
    *   The extension's service worker.
    *   Runs in the background, listening for messages from content scripts and the popup.
    *   Handles core logic such as saving titles, orchestrating CSV generation and download (`chrome.downloads` API), and clearing stored data.
    *   Initializes local storage via `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`.
*   **`backgroundstorageoperations.js`**:
    *   A utility module for `background.js` that encapsulates all `chrome.storage.local` operations (saving, retrieving, clearing titles). Promotes separation of concerns.
*   **`extensionpopuphtml.html`**:
    *   HTML file defining the structure and layout of the extension's popup window, which appears when the toolbar icon is clicked.
*   **`extensionpopupcss.css`**:
    *   CSS file for styling the elements within `extensionpopuphtml.html`, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly popup interface.
*   **`extensionpopupcontroller.js`**:
    *   The primary JavaScript file for the popup.
    *   Handles user interactions within the popup (e.g., button clicks for export/clear), sends messages to the background script, and updates the popup's display (e.g., title count).
*   **`enhancedpopupfunctionality.js`**:
    *   Contains additional JavaScript to support more complex features or interactions within the popup, working alongside `extensionpopupcontroller.js`. This could include features like displaying the list of saved titles directly in the popup.
*   **`extensionconstants.js`**:
    *   A JavaScript module for storing shared constants used across different parts of the extension.
    *   This includes storage keys, message action types, and potentially the DOM selectors for identifying AppSumo product titles.
*   **`_locales/en/messages.json`**:
    *   Standard Chrome extension internationalization (i18n) file for English language strings.
    *   Used for localizing UI text in the popup, extension name, description, etc., accessible via `chrome.i18n.getMessage()`.
*   **`localizationsupport.json`**:
    *   This file's role may be for custom localization mechanisms, managing specific UI strings outside the standard `_locales` system, or for legacy string management. Its exact use should be coordinated with `_locales/en/messages.json`.
*   **`messages.json` (root level)**:
    *   The purpose of this file is distinct from UI localization (`_locales`) and general constants (`extensionconstants.js`). It could be used for storing:
        *   Complex message formats or templates not suitable for simple string replacement.
        *   Non-translatable message configurations.
        *   Other specific static text data used by the extension logic.
*   **`appsumo_titles.csv`**:
    *   This is **not** a source code file included in the extension package. It represents an *example* of the CSV file generated by the extension when a user exports their collected titles.

## Key Considerations

*   **DOM Selectors:** The reliability of identifying product titles in `appsumocontentscript.js` heavily depends on AppSumo's website HTML structure. These selectors (likely stored in `extensionconstants.js` or directly in the content script) may need frequent updates if AppSumo changes its site layout.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks, user notifications for failures like storage issues or failed downloads) is crucial for a good user experience.
*   **Duplicate Titles:** The current design allows duplicate titles to be saved. Future enhancements could offer an option to store only unique titles.
*   **Internationalization (i18n) & Messaging Structure:**
    *   The extension uses `_locales/en/messages.json` for standard Chrome i18n, with `default_locale: "en"` in `manifest.json`.
    *   The roles of `localizationsupport.json` (custom/legacy string needs) and the root-level `messages.json` (complex message templates, non-UI static data) should be clearly defined and utilized consistently to avoid confusion.
*   **User Experience:** Clear visual feedback from the content script and an intuitive popup interface are important for usability.
*   **Permissions:** The `manifest.json` must correctly request necessary permissions: `storage` (for `chrome.storage.local`), `downloads` (for `chrome.downloads.download`), `scripting` (for injecting content scripts), and appropriate `host_permissions` (e.g., `*://*.appsumo.com/*`).
*   **Missing Extension Icons:** The project plan does not explicitly list standard extension icon files (e.g., 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels). These are essential for the extension's presentation in the Chrome toolbar, extensions page, etc., and should be added and defined in `manifest.json`. Without them, Chrome will display a default icon.

## Dependencies

*   Google Chrome Browser
*   Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3)

## Example `manifest.json`

Below is an illustrative example of what the `manifest.json` might look like, based on the project details. Note that actual icon files would need to be created and referenced.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "__MSG_extensionName__", // Using i18n for name
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "__MSG_extensionDescription__", // Using i18n for description
  "default_locale": "en",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",      // For chrome.storage.local
    "scripting",    // For injecting content scripts dynamically if needed, or for executeScript
    "downloads"     // For chrome.downloads.download API
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.appsumo.com/*" // To run content scripts and interact with AppSumo pages
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "*://*.appsumo.com/browse/*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/search/*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/products/*"
      ],
      "js": ["appsumocontentscript.js"],
      "css": ["appsumocontentstyle.css"]
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "extensionpopuphtml.html",
    "default_title": "__MSG_extensionActionTitle__", // Tooltip for the toolbar icon
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",  // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
      "32": "icons/icon32.png",  // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",  // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
      "128": "icons/icon128.png" // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
    }
  },
  "icons": { // General extension icons for management page, etc.
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",   // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
    "32": "icons/icon32.png",   // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",   // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"  // Placeholder: Requires actual icon file
  }
}
```
**Note on Icons:** The `manifest.json` example above includes placeholders for icon paths. Actual icon image files (e.g., `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`) need to be created and placed in an `icons` folder (or your chosen path) within the extension's directory.
